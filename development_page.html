                        Perfect Dark was developed by Rare and originally directed by Martin Hollis as a spiritual
                        successor to the company's 1997 first-person shooter GoldenEye 007. Shortly after
                        GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare was planning to work on a game based on the GoldenEye
                        sequel Tomorrow Never Dies, but the company was outbid by Electronic Arts, which would release
                        their video game adaptation in 1999. The result did not upset the developers, who felt
                        they had already spent too much time immersed in the James Bond universe. Working titles for
                        the new project included "Covert Ops" and "Alien Intelligence" before the words "Perfect Dark"
                        were decided on. The word "Dark" was chosen for its association with the game's bleak focus
                        on killing. Hollis noted naming similarities to the 2006 first-person shooter Black by
                        Criterion Games: "Game developers just like black, nihilism, dystopian futures, the number zero,
                        infinity, spheres, perfectionâ€”all that kind of stuff". The double slash symbol in the game's
                        logo was inspired by the Japanese writing system, while the bad grammar of the phrase
                        "Perfect Dark" partially alludes to Hollis' affection for the way Japanese developers use
                        English words in their own games and products.

                        The decision to make the central character a woman was part of Hollis' belief that there should
                        be more games starring women, considering the fact that GoldenEye 007 already starred a man.
                        To this end, the team created Joanna Dark, influenced by a number of fictional heroines: Kim
                        Kimberly from the 1983 interactive fiction game Snowball, the seductive spy Agent X-27 in the
                        1931 film Dishonored, the eponymous femme fatale of the 1990 film La Femme Nikita, and FBI agent
                        Dana Scully from The X-Files. The name "Joanna Dark" was taken from the French pronunciation
                        of Joan of Arc as "Jeanne d'Arc", while the name of the in-game company dataDyne was inspired by
                        Yoyodyne from the 1965 novella The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon. The layout of the Air
                        Force One level was inspired by the 1997 film of the same name because it was the only reference
                        material the team had. In the game's Counter-Operative mode, the idea that the opposing
                        player can take control of another opponent at any time was inspired by the 1999 film The
                        Matrix, where agents can reappear as another person in the film's simulated reality.

                        When production of the game started, the developers upgraded the GoldenEye 007 game engine with
                        new features and enhancements such as real-time lighting and support for bigger environments and
                        more textures.[30] According to Rare, only 30% of the original engine remained, providing a
                        basic framework to construct levels and animate characters.[31] A new movement system was
                        constructed, allowing players to fall off edges.[22] Other incremental improvements included
                        better shattering glass effects, which would allow players to shoot out objects such as bottles
                        of wine, and the inclusion of computer-controlled bots in multiplayer matches.[25] The
                        artificial intelligence was improved so that opponents could work as a team and draw a secondary
                        weapon when disarmed.[32][33] Death cries and more elaborate gore effects, which allow gunshots
                        to disperse and stain enemies' blood onto nearby walls and objects, were also added.[34]
