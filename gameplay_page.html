            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
            <p>Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter where players complete levels to unlock content and
                progress through the game's storyline.Players manoeuvre their character from a first-person
                perspective and have the ability to lean left or right, look up or down, crouch, crawl, and drop
                from most ledges; there is no jump ability. Interaction with the environment is via a single
                context-sensitive button, which can activate computers, operate lifts, and open doors.
                Players can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from handguns to assault rifles,
                rocket launchers, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and combat knives.
                Besides their primary mode of fire, weapons have a secondary function that enables an alternate
                fire mode or grants players special abilities. For example,
                the secondary function of the K7 Avenger assault rifle detects threats like explosive devices.
                Most weapons have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots.
                Some can be used in duplicate, one in each hand.

                <p>Perfect Dark features a campaign mode where a single player controls the game's protagonist,
                    Joanna Dark, through a series of levels collected together into missions.
                    In each level, the player must complete a set of objectives while opponents controlled by
                    the game's artificial intelligence try to hinder the player's progress. Objectives generally
                    require the recovery and use of high-tech gadgets like night-vision goggles or door
                    decoders.
                    The player has freedom as to how to approach encounters and many objectives can be completed
                    in a nonlinear order.Stealth is an important element of the gameplay because the player can
                    kill
                    opponents without being seen or remain undetected by using disguises.If Joanna fails
                    an objective or her health is fully depleted, the player must start the level again from the
                    beginning.

                <h2>Multiplayer</h2>
                <p>Perfect Dark features a multiplayer mode where up to four players and eight
                    computer-controlled
                    bots can compete against each other in different arenas. A split-screen is used for multiple
                    players. Players start a game unarmed and with a certain amount of health. Weapons and
                    ammunition
                    are placed around the arena in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are
                    regenerated
                    unarmed elsewhere in the arena. The objective of each game is determined by the scenario
                    being
                    played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by
                    killing opponents, to objective-based modes such as Capture the Flag and King of the
                    Hill.[14]
                    Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive
                    with
                    it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a game type where players score points by
                    hacking
                    a computer system using a data uplink device.
