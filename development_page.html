                            Perfect Dark was developed by Rare and originally directed by Martin Hollis as a spiritual
                            successor to the company's 1997 first-person shooter GoldenEye 007. Shortly after
                            GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare was planning to work on a game based on the GoldenEye
                            sequel Tomorrow Never Dies, but the company was outbid by Electronic Arts, which would
                            release
                            their video game adaptation in 1999. The result did not upset the developers, who felt
                            they had already spent too much time immersed in the James Bond universe. Working titles for
                            the new project included "Covert Ops" and "Alien Intelligence" before the words "Perfect
                            Dark"
                            were decided on. The word "Dark" was chosen for its association with the game's bleak focus
                            on killing. Hollis noted naming similarities to the 2006 first-person shooter Black by
                            Criterion Games: "Game developers just like black, nihilism, dystopian futures, the number
                            zero,
                            infinity, spheres, perfectionâ€”all that kind of stuff". The double slash symbol in the game's
                            logo was inspired by the Japanese writing system, while the bad grammar of the phrase
                            "Perfect Dark" partially alludes to Hollis' affection for the way Japanese developers use
                            English words in their own games and products.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The decision to make the central character a woman was part of Hollis' belief that there
                            should be more games starring women, considering the fact that GoldenEye 007 already starred
                            a man.[26] To this end, the team created Joanna Dark, influenced by a number of fictional
                            heroines: Kim Kimberly from the 1983 interactive fiction game Snowball, the seductive spy
                            Agent X-27 in the 1931 film Dishonored, the eponymous femme fatale of the 1990 film La Femme
                            Nikita, and FBI agent Dana Scully from The X-Files.[26] The name "Joanna Dark" was taken
                            from the French pronunciation of Joan of Arc as "Jeanne d'Arc", while the name of the
                            in-game company dataDyne was inspired by Yoyodyne from the 1965 novella The Crying of Lot 49
                            by Thomas Pynchon.[24] The layout of the Air Force One level was inspired by the 1997 film
                            of the same name because it was the only reference material the team had.[25] In the game's
                            Counter-Operative mode, the idea that the opposing player can take control of another
                            opponent at any time was inspired by the 1999 film The Matrix, where agents can reappear as
                            another person in the film's simulated reality.[25]

                            When production of the game started, the developers upgraded the GoldenEye 007 game engine
                            with
                            new features and enhancements such as real-time lighting and support for bigger environments
                            and
                            more textures. According to Rare, only 30% of the original engine remained, providing a
                            basic framework to construct levels and animate characters. A new movement system was
                            constructed, allowing players to fall off edges. Other incremental improvements included
                            better shattering glass effects, which would allow players to shoot out objects such as
                            bottles
                            of wine, and the inclusion of computer-controlled bots in multiplayer matches. The
                            artificial intelligence was improved so that opponents could work as a team and draw a
                            secondary
                            weapon when disarmed. Death cries and more elaborate gore effects, which allow
                            gunshots
                            to disperse and stain enemies' blood onto nearby walls and objects, were also added
