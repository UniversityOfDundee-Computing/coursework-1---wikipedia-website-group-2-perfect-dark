                        Although a follow-up to GoldenEye 007 was confirmed to be in development in early 1998,
                        Perfect Dark was formally presented as Nintendo's lead game at E3 1998 in Atlanta, Georgia.
                        Originally scheduled for a release in summer 1999 and later in December 1999,
                        Perfect Dark was heavily trailed in video game magazines, with Nintendo Official Magazine
                        predicting that it would be "the best shooting game this century". A working version of the
                        game appeared at the European Computer Trade Show in September 1998; N64 Magazine described
                        the preview as having "the kind of attention to detail that had everyone who saw [it]
                        drooling". A more complete version was presented at E3 in May 1999, where the game's
                        compatibility with the Game Boy Camera was announced, and at Nintendo Space World in August
                        1999, alongside Rare's Donkey Kong 64 and Jet Force Gemini. Shortly before release, Rare
                        unveiled a website for the in-game company dataDyne to promote interest in the game's
                        storyline. The game had a marketing budget of $10 million. </p>

                        Perfect Dark was first released in North America on 22 May 2000. Nintendo arranged a number
                        of publicity stunts, including hiring model Michele Merkin, who appeared as Joanna Dark in
                        commercials and in-store promotions for the game. The game received a Mature rating from
                        the Entertainment Software Rating Board, particularly for its graphic content and adult
                        language. This generated some controversy because Nintendo has a reputation for
                        family-friendly games. The European release followed on 30 June 2000. To supplement the
                        game, Rare released a Game Boy Color counterpart, also titled Perfect Dark, shortly
                        afterwards. The Game Boy Color game features a compatibility mode that allows certain cheats
                        within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked via the Transfer Pak. In Japan,
                        Perfect Dark was released on 21 October 2000.

                        Perfect Dark features a different box art for each regional release. Rare's art director Kev
                        Bayliss, who created the North American and European artworks, designed the North American
                        version in one day because Rare needed it very quickly. He then created a more suitable
                        Joanna Dark model for the European version and all the promotional material at the time. For
                        the Japanese release, a completely different image was requested by Nintendo, who originally
                        considered releasing the game in Japan under the title "Aka to Kuro" (赤と黒, lit. "Red and
                        Black"). "Perfect Dark" does not translate well into Japanese, and the title "Aka to Kuro"
                        was considered sufficiently edgy. The game was ultimately released as パーフェクト・ダーク (Pāfekuto
                        Dāku), a transliteration of the Western title.

                        According to NPD's Toy Retail Survey Tracking system, Perfect Dark was the second best-selling
                        game of May 2000 in North America, behind Pokémon Trading Card Game. The Japanese launch saw
                        sales totalling 35,000 units in its first week. As a bestseller, Perfect Dark joined
                        Nintendo's "Player's Choice" game selection on 21 December 2000. The game sold relatively
                        well through the year's holiday season, reaching No. 23 on the all formats chart for the week of
                        24 December 2000. As of March 2003, Perfect Dark had sold almost 1.3 million copies in the
                        United States and 77,000 copies in Japan. Total sales in the United States reached 1.5
                        million by December 2007. In a 2011 interview with Eurogamer, game designer Chris Tilston
                        revealed that lifetime sales for the game reached 3.2 million, but did not clarify if the figure
                        accounted for units shipped to retailers.</p>
