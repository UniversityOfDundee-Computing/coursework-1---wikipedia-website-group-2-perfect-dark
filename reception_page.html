                    <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Perfect Dark received critical acclaim from video
                        game publications.
                        The most praised aspects of the game were its graphics, artificial intelligence,
                        and number of multiplayer options.GameSpot claimed that, as a console first-person shooter,
                        Perfect Dark is "unparalleled", while IGN journalist Matt Casamassina remarked that its
                        extensive
                        features set the game apart from its peers. Similarly, N64 Magazine described Perfect Dark
                        as "dauntingly huge", stating that it "takes everything that made its predecessor such an
                        enduring
                        favourite and does it bigger, better and more often". Edge concluded that, although the game
                        fails to be
                        as revolutionary as its predecessor, it refines its "phenomenal gameplay while massively
                        developing its
                        multiplayer components". Nintendo Power editors called the game "undeniably a work of art",
                        suspenseful,
                        "more compelling than most action movies and much deeper than any video game of its type".

                <p>The graphics were praised for their dynamic lighting, complex geometry, varied textures,
                    and smooth animations. IGN remarked that levels were more detailed than in
                    GoldenEye 007, and that character models and weapons were well-animated. GameRevolution
                    highlighted the game's semi-realistic look, saying that it "adds to the depth and addiction
                    of the game". The game's voiced cutscenes, surround sound effects, and atmospheric score,
                    which was described as a mixture between the Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis and GoldenEye
                    007's, were said to effectively bring the game to life. The Electric Playground
                    credited Rare for being able to fit such a clear sounding experience into the limited space of a
                    Nintendo 64 cartridge.

                <p>The gameplay was praised for the challenging artificial intelligence of enemies and varied level
                    design. The enemies were admired for their use of squad tactics,
                    ability to wait for players to come back instead of obediently chasing after them,
                    and for ducking around a corner for cover. As with GoldenEye 007, the game's
                    nonlinear approach to completing mission objectives was highlighted positively, giving
                    players freedom to deal with situations as they see fit. The multiplayer mode was seen
                    as the strongest aspect of the game. Reviewers noted that the flexibility of options, number
                    of gameplay modes, "clever" weapons, number of unlockable features, and customisable computer-
                    controlled bots give the game an unprecedented amount of replay value. GamePro
                    called the game's Counter-Operative mode one of the "coolest multiplayer modes ever", stating that
                    the
                    player playing as Joanna never knows which enemy the opposing player controls.
