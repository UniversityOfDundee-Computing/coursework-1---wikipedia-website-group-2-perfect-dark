                        Shortly after Perfect Dark was released, Rare planned to develop a "sister" title, called Velvet
                        Dark, for either the Nintendo 64 or its successor, the GameCube, but the project was ultimately
                        abandoned.[98] The name "Velvet Dark" references Joanna Dark's alleged sister, the character
                        players assume the role of in the game's co-operative mode.[98] Meanwhile, Free Radical Design
                        released TimeSplitters for the PlayStation 2 in October 2000, a first-person shooter based
                        around a completely new engine.[99] TimeSplitters bears several gameplay and presentational
                        similarities to GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, including a similar aiming system and unlockable
                        options through quick level completions.[99][100] After Rare was purchased by Microsoft in
                        2002,[101] the company released a prequel, Perfect Dark Zero, as a launch title for the Xbox 360
                        in 2005. Although the game received generally positive reviews from critics,[102] some
                        publications felt it did not meet their expectations.[103][104]

                        In a retrospective analysis, Edge acknowledged that the game's frame rate and other dated
                        elements of its design rendered it "nigh-on unplayable".[105] The magazine found the ambitious
                        mentality which resulted in weapons and computer-controlled players being "designed for
                        possibilities rather than balance", both one of Perfect Dark's most interesting aspects and the
                        cause of its biggest problem: "Restraint [...] would have made Perfect Dark a tighter, more
                        focused experience, helped with those framerate issues, and removed almost all of the fun".[105]
                        The magazine concluded that despite Perfect Dark not standing up as a good game to play in 2009,
                        "its currency of ideas and provocation [...] remains sound".[105] In 2015, Den of Geek
                        considered Perfect Dark "a game that's done more for the shooter genre than often credited for",
                        and said that the game was still ahead of time because no game had revitalised its ideas.[106]

                        Since its release, the game has attracted a following of elite players who constantly try to
                        speedrun its levels and break world records. These records are managed by their website and
                        involve highly skilled players exploiting tiny gameplay inconsistencies. The game is
                        occasionally cited as one of the greatest video games of all time by some publications. In 2006,
                        Perfect Dark was placed at No. 15 on IGN's Readers Choice Top 100 Games Ever, while
                        Nintendo Power included it in their list of Top 200 Nintendo games. In 2007, IGN editors
                        placed the game at No. 86 on their list of Top 100 Games of All Time, noting that "Everything
                        that GoldenEye made great, Perfect Dark did too, and then some."Similarly, Edge placed the
                        title at No. 28 on their 2007 list of 100 Best Videogames (a list voted for by readers, Edge
                        staff and gaming industry professionals). The magazine claimed that the game brought the
                        Nintendo 64 era to a satisfying close. In 2009, Official Nintendo Magazine ranked it 37th
                        on a list of 100 Best Nintendo Games.

                        In 2022, a fan by the name of Ryan Dwyer fully decompiled the original ROM image into C source
                        code, allowing the game to be ported unofficially to various platforms. A reboot, also
                        titled Perfect Dark, is being developed by The Initiative.
